# Data analysis

This is an R Markdown document reporting an analysis of biometric data. It will contain:
Commit containing full submission
Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
Mean and median number of steps taken each day
Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
All of the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report

```{Obtaining data, echo = TRUE}

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{total steps, echo=TRUE}
df1 <- tapply(activity$steps, factor(activity$date), 
              sum, na.rm = TRUE)
df1 <- as.data.frame(df1)
colnames(df1) <- "total_steps"
plot <- ggplot(df1) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = rownames(df1), y = total_steps), stat = "identity")
plot
```

````{mean and median daily steps, echo = TRUE}
mean(df1$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median(df1$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
````

## time series
```{time series steps daily, echo=TRUE}
df2 <- tapply(activity$steps, factor(activity$interval), 
              mean, na.rm = TRUE)
df2 <- as.data.frame(df2)
colnames(df2) <- "steps"
p2 <- ggplot(df2) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = rownames(df2), y = steps))
p2
```

## time of day with maximum steps
```` {max steps time, echo = TRUE}
rownames(df2)[max(df2$steps)]
````

## missing values
### determining how many
```` {r, echo = TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
table(is.na(activity$steps))
````
So 2304 measurements of 17568 are NA.

### imputing averages in for that time of day
```` {r, echo = TRUE}
df2 <- tapply(activity$steps, factor(activity$interval), 
              mean, na.rm = TRUE)
missing <- which(is.na(activity))
activitymissing <- activity[missing,]
head(activitymissing)
df2$interval = rownames(df2)
activitymissing <- merge(activitymissing, df2, by =
                                               "interval")
activity<- na.omit(activity)
activitymissing <- activitymissing[,c(1, 3:4)]
colnames(activitymissing) <- c("interval", "date", "steps")
activity <- rbind(activity, activitymissing)
````

### check graphs after imputing data
```` {r, echo = TRUE}
df3 <- tapply(activity$steps, factor(activity$date), 
              sum, na.rm = TRUE)
df3 <- as.data.frame(df3)
colnames(df3) <- "total_steps"
plot <- ggplot(df3) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = rownames(df3), y = total_steps), stat = "identity")
plot

mean(df3$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median(df3$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)

df4 <- tapply(activity$steps, factor(activity$interval), 
              mean, na.rm = TRUE)
df4 <- as.data.frame(df4)
colnames(df4) <- "steps"
p4 <- ggplot(df4) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = rownames(df4), y = steps))
p4
````
Mean and median are now equal to each other after replacing average interval data; both higher now than before

## now look at this by weekend vs weekday
```` {r, echo = TRUE}
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)
activity$weekday <- weekdays(activity$date)
activity$weekday <- replace(activity$weekday, activity$weekday %in%
                              c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
                                "Thursday", "Friday"),
                            c("Weekday"))
activity$weekday <- replace(activity$weekday, activity$weekday %in%
                              c("Saturday", "Sunday"),
                            c("Weekend"))


p6 <- xyplot(steps ~ interval | weekday,
       data = activity,
       type = "l")
p6
````


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
